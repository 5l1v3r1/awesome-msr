# awesome-msr [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
A curated repository of data sets and tools that can be used for data-driven empirical software engineering, a method also known as _mining software repositories_ (MSR). For examples of such work see the [Mining Software Repositories](http://2016.msrconf.org/#/hall-of-fame) conference.


This list is under construction and requires your input. Please contribute additions through a GitHub pull request.  (Or send me an [email](mailto:dds@aueb.gr) if you find that too cumbersome.) The additions you specify should be genuinely useful to MSR researchers; the objective of this list is utility rather than comprehensiveness.

For more awesome lists, see [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).

## Data Sets
* [AndroZoo](https://androzoo.uni.lu/) - a growing collection of Android Applications
* [Boa](http://boa.cs.iastate.edu/) - a domain-specific language and infrastructure that eases mining software repositories
* [Code Reviews](http://kin-y.github.io/miningReviewRepo/) - Code reviews of OpenStack, LibreOffice, AOSP, Qt, Eclipse
* [Enron Spreadsheets and Emails](https://figshare.com/articles/Enron_Spreadsheets_and_Emails/1221767) - all the spreadsheets and emails used in the paper 'Enron's Spreadsheets and Related Emails: A Dataset and Analysis'
* [Findbugs-maven](https://github.com/istlab/maven_bug_catalog) - a set of FindBugs reports for the Java projects of the [Maven repository](https://maven.apache.org)
* [GHTorrent](http://ghtorrent.org/) - an effort to create a scalable, queriable, offline mirror of data offered through the Github REST API
* [Maven metrics](https://github.com/bkarak/data_msr2015) - a collection of software complexity & sizing metrics for the [Maven Repository](https://maven.apache.org)
* [mzdata](https://github.com/jxshin/mzdata) -  Multi-extract and Multi-level Dataset of Mozilla Issue Tracking History
* [RepoReapers Data Set](https://reporeapers.github.io) - A data set containing a collection of _engineered software projects_ from GHTorrent.
* [Stack Exchange](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange) - an anonymized dump of all user-contributed content on the Stack Exchange network.
* [tera-PROMISE](http://openscience.us/repo/) - a research dataset repository specializing in software engineering research datasets. This has now been moved to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) and is called [SeaCraft](http://zenodo.org/communities/seacraft)
* [TravisTorrent](http://travistorrent.testroots.org) - TravisTorrent provides free and easy-to-use Traivs CI build analyses.
* [Unix history](https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo) - a Git repository with 46 years of Unix history evolution

## Tools
* [ckjm](http://www.spinellis.gr/sw/ckjm/) - Chidamber and Kemerer Java Metrics  
* [MetricMiner](http://www.github.com/mauricioaniche/metricminer2) - a lean Java DSL to
mine and extract data (e.g. commits, developers, modifications, diffs) from Git and SVN repositories
* [qmcalc](https://github.com/dspinellis/cqmetrics) - calculate quality metrics from C source code
* [`reaper`](https://github.com/RepoReapers/reaper) - A Python tool to compute a score for a repository from GHTorrent. The score quantifies the extent to which the project contained within the repository is _engineered_.
