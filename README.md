# awesome-msr [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
A curated repository of data sets and tools that can be used for data-driven empirical software engineering, a method also known as _mining software repositories_ (MSR). For examples of such work see the [Mining Software Repositories](http://2016.msrconf.org/#/hall-of-fame) conference.


This list is under construction and requires your input. Please contribute additions through a GitHub pull request.  (Or send me an [email](mailto:dds@aueb.gr) if you find that too cumbersome.) The additions you specify should be genuinely useful to MSR researchers; the objective of this list is utility rather than comprehensiveness.

For more awesome lists, see [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).
